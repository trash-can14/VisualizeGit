# vgit – Visual Git Educational Tool

## License
GPL-3.0-or-later

## Overview
vgit is a free and open-source interactive visualizer for Git commands.
It helps you see what Git is doing under the hood — staging, committing, fetching, amending — using terminal animations.

This project is designed for students, educators, and anyone learning Git.

## Features
* Visualize common Git operations such as status, fetch, and commit with animated terminal graphics.
* See how branches, commits, and staging areas change over time.
* Consistent, easy-to-understand animations.
* Runs entirely in the terminal — no extra GUI tools required.

## Installation
Install vgit globally via pip:

```bash
pip install vgit
```

Or, install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Orange-Tofu/VisualizeGit
cd VisualizeGit
pip install .
```

This installs the vgit command globally.

# Usage

## Getting Started
Once installed, you can use vgit by running the following command:

```bash
vgit status
```

## Other examples:

```bash
vgit fetch
vgit commit -m "Add new feature"
vgit commit --amend --no-edit
```

## During development (without installing):

```bash
python cli.py status
python cli.py fetch
python cli.py commit -m "message"
```
